It's generally a good idea to encourage knowledge sharing within the engineering team. The difficult part though seems to be making it regular, part of the day-to-day job, equally important as writing the code or testing the product.

### Previous approach
In our team we had this idea of Knowledge Sharing meeting. Every two weeks we had 1 hour slot booked for all iOS engineers to meet together. Every session would have someone to present a topic, usually in a form of presentation and / or code walkthrough. Then at the end we would have a short discussion about the subject.

This approach presented a few problems:
- Topics took time to prepare. Because of that the sessions were often delayed / cancelled.
- It was sometimes hard to get someone to commit to prepare a topic, having that implicit (and probably unjustified - read on) expectation that it has to be something well prepared and thoroughly researched.

As a result we ended up not having that many knowledge sharing sessions as we hoped for.

### New approach
Seeing that previous approach wasn't really effective in what we wanted to be I proposed that we try a different approach.

The new idea is based on a few simple rules:
- Each session (every two weeks) has an owner that is responsible for bringing the topic.
- The topics should be short and not require much (or any) preparation.
- The main part of the session is the discussion, not the presentation.

Overall the main benefit of the new approach should be the following: **Every two weeks the knowledge sharing session will happen**.

### How to find a topic
My idea for the knowledge sharing topics was to make it easy. Some examples that I propose:
- Did you read an interesting article recently? Can be iOS, can be engineering in general. Bring it, summarise it, go together through code examples (if applicable).
- Did you recently solve a challenging, tricky bug in our codebase? Walk us through the solution (yes, it should be part of the good pull request too, but in a bigger team probably not that many people have seen it before it got merged).
- Did you encounter some interesting problem when working on your side project? Tell us about it, show some code example if you can.
- Are there some important changes coming up in the tool your team uses? Or in the general ecosystem relevant to your domain? Bring the changelog (or a good article summarising the changes), go through them together.

### Would it work?
We've only just started with that new approach, so given our current schedule it will take a couple of months to evaluate how are we doing. One thing though that I already noticed is that by having a short, almost casual topic, it's easy to start some discussions around it, that are interesting in itself, but also sometimes lead to quite unexpected learnings in other, only loosely related domains.

### Regular by default, extensive optionally
At the end, it's worth emphasising that using this new approach does not mean we cannot have bigger, well researched topics prepared, whenever someone wants to do it.

But by making it optional, my hope is to lower the pressure while doing so, while sticking to the principle of making the sessions regular by default. And extensive only optionally.
